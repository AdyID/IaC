PUNS: list[str] = [
    "I'm going through a solid phase right now, just trying to keep it together.",
    "Liquid water is pretty chill… until things heat up.",
    "Gas molecules? They’re just full of hot air.",
    "I told my friends about plasma, but it didn’t get a solid reaction.",
    "Life is all about phase changes… you just have to go with the flow.",
    "Ice to meet you, let’s break the surface tension.",
    "I’m in my vapor phase, I rise above the drama.",

FACTS: list[str] = [
    "There’s more than just solid, liquid, gas. Plasma is the fourth common phase, and there are exotic phases like Bose–Einstein condensates and time crystals.",
    "Phase changes can absorb or release heat without changing temperature, e.g., ice melts at 0 °C and water boils at 100 °C.",
    "Supercooled liquids can stay liquid below their freezing point until disturbed. One tap, and boom, instant ice.",
    "Phase transitions happen in space too, stellar interiors shift phases under extreme pressure and temperature.",
    "Quantum phase transitions occur at absolute zero, driven by quantum fluctuations rather than temperature.",
