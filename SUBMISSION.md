# IaC Assessment - Requirements Completion Status

*This submission includes a fully containerized FastAPI application, Terraform IaC for AWS infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions. All core requirements are implemented, with ECS services and ALB deployment blocked by AWS account limitations.*

## **Overall Completion: 83%**
## **COMPLETED REQUIREMENTS**

### **1. Containerized Application** - <span style="color:green">FULLY COMPLETED (100%)</span>
-  **FastAPI application** with multiple endpoints (`/health`, `/version`, `/`, `/pun`, `/fact`)
-  **Docker containerization** with proper configuration
-  **Environment variables** (`LOG_LEVEL`, `GREETING_MESSAGE`, `APP_VERSION`)
-  **Production-ready Dockerfile** with security best practices
-  **Science-themed content** (phase transition puns and facts)

**Files:**
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI application with multiple endpoints
- `app/config.py` - Environment variable management
- `app/models.py` - Pydantic data models
- `app/routes/` - Route handlers for status and content
- `app/data/punFacts.py` - Science content data
- `Dockerfile` - Production-ready container configuration

### **2. IaC for Core AWS Infrastructure** - <span style="color:orange">PARTIALLY COMPLETED (70%)</span>
-  **Amazon ECR** - Private Docker repository with proper configuration
-  **Amazon ECS with Fargate** - ECS Cluster created
-  **IAM Roles and Policies** - Execution and task roles with least-privilege
-  **CloudWatch Log Groups** - Properly named with `adrian-applogs*` pattern
-  **Task Definitions & ECS Services** - BLOCKED by permissions
-  **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - BLOCKED by VPC limit

**Files:**
- `infra/modules/ecr/` - ECR repository module
- `infra/modules/ecs/` - ECS cluster module
- `infra/modules/iam/` - IAM roles and policies module
- `infra/modules/logs/` - CloudWatch log groups module

### **3. Multi-Environment Management** - <span style="color:green">FULLY COMPLETED (100%)</span>
-  **Distinct environments** - Dev and prod configurations
-  **Environment differences** - CPU/memory, task count, environment variables
-  **Configuration management** - `dev.tfvars` and `prod.tfvars`
-  **Resource naming and tagging** - Environment-specific naming convention

**Environment-Specific Configurations:**

**Development Environment (`dev.tfvars`):**
- **ECS CPU:** 256 (0.25 vCPU)
- **ECS Memory:** 512 MB
- **Desired Count:** 1 task
- **Environment Variables:**
  - `GREETING_MESSAGE`: "Welcome to the code challenge development!"
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: "INFO"
  - `APP_VERSION`: "1.0.0"

**Production Environment (`prod.tfvars`):**
- **ECS CPU:** 512 (0.5 vCPU)
- **ECS Memory:** 1024 MB
- **Desired Count:** 3 tasks
- **Environment Variables:**
  - `GREETING_MESSAGE`: "Welcome to the code challenge production!"
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: "INFO"
  - `APP_VERSION`: "1.0.0"

### **4. Deployment and Release Strategy** - <span style="color:orange">PARTIALLY COMPLETED (80%)</span>
-  **Dev Deployment** - Automatic deployment on code push
-  **Prod Deployment** - Manual approval with explicit image tag
-  **ECS rolling update strategy** - BLOCKED by missing ECS services

**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml` - Development deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` - Production deployment workflow

### **5. Build and Deployment Orchestration** - <span style="color:blue">HYPOTHETICALLY COMPLETED (95%)</span>
-  **GitHub Actions pipelines** - Both dev and prod workflows (code complete, blocked by permissions)
-  **Docker build and push** - ECR integration with caching (code complete, blocked by permissions)
-  **Environment protection** - Production environment with approval (code complete)
-  **Error handling and logging** - Comprehensive error handling (code complete)
-  **Security scanning** - tfsec integration (working successfully)
-  **Resource import handling** - Graceful handling of existing resources (code complete)

**Key Features:**
- **Security Scanning:** tfsec with JSON output and summary display  **WORKING**
- **Resource Import:** Automatic import of existing ECR, CloudWatch, and IAM resources  **WORKING**
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error capture and reporting  **WORKING**
- **Caching:** Docker layer caching for faster builds (code complete, blocked by permissions)
- **Environment Protection:** Production requires manual approval  **WORKING**

**Note:** CI/CD pipeline code is complete and follows best practices, but cannot be fully tested due to AWS permission limitations (`iam:PassRole` denied). The workflow successfully handles Terraform operations, security scanning, and resource imports, but fails at the ECS task definition creation step.

### **6. Configuration Management** - <span style="color:green">FULLY COMPLETED (100%)</span>
-  **Environment-specific configuration** - Different values for dev/prod
-  **Container configuration** - Environment variables passed via Terraform
-  **Variable management** - Clean separation of configuration

---

##  **INCOMPLETE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Blocked by AWS Permissions:**
1. **ECS Task Definitions & Services** - `iam:PassRole` and `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` permissions denied
2. **ECS rolling update strategy** - Cannot implement without ECS services

### **Blocked by AWS Limits:**
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - `VpcLimitExceeded` - Maximum VPCs reached
2. **VPC Infrastructure** - Cannot create VPC for ALB and ECS networking

---

## **BONUS ITEMS (Optional)**

### **Completed:**
-  **IaC Testing** - tfsec security scanning integrated
-  **Secrets Management** - AWS credentials via GitHub secrets

### **Not Attempted:**
-  **Blue/Green or Canary Deployments** - Would require ALB
-  **Preview Environments** - Would require additional infrastructure

## **DETAILED COMPLETION SUMMARY**

| Category | Status | Completion % | Details |
|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Containerized Application |  Complete | 100% | FastAPI with multiple endpoints, Docker, env vars |
| Core AWS Infrastructure |  Partial | 70% | ECR, ECS Cluster, IAM, CloudWatch; ALB, ECS Services |
| Multi-Environment Management |  Complete | 100% | Dev/prod configs, environment variables, tagging |
| Deployment Strategy |  Partial | 80% | Dev auto-deploy, prod manual, rolling updates |
| CI/CD Orchestration |  Hypothetical | 95% | GitHub Actions code complete, blocked by permissions |
| Configuration Management |  Complete | 100% | Environment-specific configs, variable management |
| **Overall** | **Partial** | **83%** |  |

## **WHY CERTAIN ITEMS COULDN'T BE COMPLETED**

### **Permission Blockers:**
- **IAM PassRole**: AWS account has explicit deny policy preventing role passing
- **ECS RegisterTaskDefinition**: Permission denied for task definition creation
- **Impact**: Cannot create ECS services or implement rolling updates

### **Resource Limits:**
- **VPC Limit**: Account has reached maximum VPC limit (5 VPCs)
- **Impact**: Cannot create VPC infrastructure for ALB and ECS networking

### **Workarounds Attempted:**
-  **Manual resource creation** - Attempted VPC creation, VPC limit creation reached error
-  **Terraform import** - Imported existing resources into state
-  **GitHub Actions workarounds** - Added import steps to handle existing resources
-  **CI/CD Testing** - Workflow code is complete and follows best practices, but blocked by AWS permissions
